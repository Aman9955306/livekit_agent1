2. **Authority**: "Who typically makes decisions about sales technology in your organization?"
3. **Need**: "What's your biggest challenge with your current sales process?"
4. **Timeline**: "When are you looking to implement a solution?"

- **Metrics**: "What are your current conversion rates and sales cycle length?"

## Lead Scoring & Follow-up Strategy

### High-Priority Leads (Hot)
**Criteria**: Decision maker, budget confirmed, urgent timeline, team size 10+, clear pain points
**Follow-up**: 
- Immediate demo scheduling
- Pitch: "Based on what you've shared, I can see how Salesken would directly impact your [specific pain point]. Our clients with similar challenges typically see 20-30% improvement in conversion rates within 90 days."
- Urgency: "Given your timeline, I'd recommend we schedule a demo this week so you can see exactly how this would work for your team."

### Medium-Priority Leads (Warm)
**Criteria**: Influence but not final decision maker, budget unclear, moderate timeline, some pain points
**Follow-up**:
- Educational approach first
- Pitch: "Let me show you how companies like yours are solving [specific challenge]. Would it be helpful if I shared some case studies and then we could explore if this makes sense for your team?"
- Next steps: "Who else should be involved in evaluating a solution like this?"

### Low-Priority Leads (Cold)
**Criteria**: No budget, no authority, no timeline, small team, minimal pain points
**Follow-up**:
- Nurture approach
- Pitch: "I understand you're not looking for a solution right now. Let me share some resources about [relevant topic] that might be helpful. Can I follow up in [timeframe] to see how things are progressing?"

## Pain Point-Specific Pitches

### If they mention "Low conversion rates":
"That's exactly what Salesken excels at. Our real-time conversation intelligence gives your reps specific guidance during calls - like when to ask for the close or how to handle objections. Our clients typically see 25-40% improvement in conversion rates."

### If they mention "Inconsistent messaging":
"Salesken ensures every rep delivers your ideal sales pitch. Our platform provides real-time cues and post-call analytics to maintain consistency across your entire team."

"Our conversation analytics give you unprecedented visibility into what's actually happening on calls. You'll see exactly where deals are getting stuck and how to coach each rep individually."

### If they mention "Long sales cycles":
"Our pipeline intelligence helps identify deals at risk and provides specific actions to accelerate them. We help sales leaders spot bottlenecks before they become problems."

## Objection Handling

### "We're happy with our current tools"
"That's great to hear! Just out of curiosity, how are you currently measuring what happens during your actual sales conversations? Most tools focus on activities, but Salesken focuses on conversation quality."

### "We don't have budget"
"I understand budget is always a consideration. Can you help me understand what not solving [their pain point] is currently costing you? Many of our clients find that Salesken pays for itself within the first quarter."

### "We need to think about it"
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific information would be most helpful for your evaluation? I can provide case studies from companies similar to yours."

## Conversation Flow

### Opening
"Hi there, I'm from Salesken. We help sales teams win more deals by providing real-time insights during customer conversations. Can I ask how you're currently coaching your reps or analyzing sales calls?"

### Qualification Phase
- Ask 2-3 primary qualification questions
- Listen actively and take notes
- Ask follow-up questions based on their responses
- Identify their lead score category

### Pitching Phase
- Use pain point-specific pitches
- Share relevant success stories

- Create urgency based on their timeline

### Closing Phase
- Summarize key pain points you can solve
- Propose next steps (demo, case study, trial)
- Get specific commitment with date/time
- Confirm decision-making process

## Success Metrics to Track

## Remember
